	<h1> About Russian Blue</h1>
		<img src= "images/chachi7.jpg" alt="Chachi logo"/>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>
		The Russian Blue’s exact origin is lost to history, but it’s said to have been a favorite of the Russian Czars and Britain’s Queen Victoria. Historians believe they arrived in Europe on ships from Arkhangelsk, Russia. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The Russian Blue is a natural breed originating; from the Archangel Isles in northern Russia, where the long winters developed a cat with a dense, plush coat. That is why they are sometimes called Archangel Blues. It is also believed that sailors took them from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s.
	</p>

		<h2>Health</h2>
		<p>
		There is a slight increase in the risk of urinary tract issues and bladder stones in Russian Blues. The biggest concern is that they are prone to obesity. 
		</p>
		<p>
		They have large appetites, so you need to watch their weight. If your cat gains too much weight, it will be susceptible to the health issues common with obesity. These can include hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, respiratory issues, kidney stones, and kidney failure.
	</p>

	<h2>Care</h2>
	
	<p>
		If you maintain a good hygiene routine, your Russian blue will require minimal grooming and healthcare. There are several necessary items for keeping a cat comfortable after adoption. Such as investing in a cat-safe toothbrush and toothpaste to keep their teeth clean, also a medium-toothed comb to keep their double coat smooth and luxurious. 
		</p>
		<p>
		An important piece of Russian blue cat breed information is that these cats love mealtime, so make sure they don't overeat. They probably ask for food multiple times a day. But remains firm and sticks to regularly scheduled feedings, using measured amounts of cat food, and avoiding too many cat treats.

	<h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Russian Blue cats have a slightly upturned mouth, giving them subtle smile similar to Mona Lisa’s famous smile. </li>
	<li> According to folklore, Russian Blues were kept in the chambers of newborns to chase away evil spirits. </li>
	<li> Fans of the famous Tom and Jerry cartoon speculate that Tom, with his bright green eyes and blue-gray hue, is a Russian Blue. </li>
	<li> Some people say that the Russian blue is a good pet for people with allergies. Russian Blues do not shed much, and many people think that they’re hypoallergenic. This is not strictly true. But they do produce less glycoprotein Fel d 1 (a protein in saliva and skin that is a known allergen) than most cats. </li>
	<li> Nyan Cat was inspired by a Russian Blue cat named Marty. </li>
	<li> In Russian folklore, Russian Blues were considered good luck and healing charms. </li>
